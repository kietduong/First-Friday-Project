          Kiet Anh Duong was supposedly born in <em>Tieng Giang, Vietnam</em>. They say that a rainbow descended upon the site of his birth. The tune that the birds sang that morning was even more beautiful than normal.

It was in <em>Chicago, Il</em>. where our young Kiet grew up and though many would not say he flourished. He certainly believed he did. In 2010 he moved in with his mother in <em>Sarasota, Fl</em>. where he lived until 2016. While in Florida he attended to the prestigious Florida State University.
