    <h1>About Kiet</h1>
    <p>
      Kiet Anh Duong was supposedly born in Tieng Giang, Vietnam. They say that a rainbow descended upon the site of his birth. The tune that the birds sang that morning was even more beautiful than normal. In 1996 his parents emigrated to the United States where his famly was originally from because they believed that raising a child in America would be a better idea than South Vietnam. It was in Chicago, Il. where our young Kiet grew up and though many would not say he flourished. He certainly believed he did. In 2010 he moved in with his mother in Sarasota, Fl. where he lived until 2016. He attended to the prestigious Florida State University. His first year there, the college's football team won the ncaa national championship and went on an unprecedented winning streak. He promptly celebrated the champioship by running aorund the liquor store where he worked. Naked. He currently lives in Portland and attends Epicodus where he intends on learning coding and programming while he figures out what he wants to do with his life.
